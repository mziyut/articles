## Introduction

Since Packer v1.7.0, it is recommended to use HCL2 instead of JSON for Packer templates.
The `.pkr.hcl` file generated by the `hcl2_upgrade` command, which converts a Packer template written in JSON to HCL2 format, will output `"template: hcl2_upgrade:3: unexpected \"\\\\\" in operand"` in the `.pkr.hcl` file generated by executing the `.pkr.hcl` command.

## Solution

https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/issues/10728#issuecomment-793199077

In this case, the `\"` (escaped quote) used for escaping was not parsing JSON properly.
You can work around this problem by changing `\"` (escaped quote) to backtick.

### Before

Running `packer hcl2_upgrade` on a JSON file defined as follows...

```json
{
  "builders": [{
    "type": "amazon-ebs", ...
    ...
    "ami_name": "ami_name-{{isotime \"2006-01-02-15-04-MST\"| clean_resource_name}}"
  }], }
}
```

The following `.pkr.hcl` file will be generated.

```hcl
# could not parse template for the following block: "template: hcl2_upgrade:3: unexpected \"\\\\\" in operand"

source "amazon-ebs" "autogenerated_1" {
  ami_name = "ami_name-{{isotime \"2006-01-02-15-04-MST\"| clean_resource_name}}"
```

### After

After changing the description and running `packer hcl2_upgrade`...

```json
{
  "builders": [{
    "type": "amazon-ebs",.
    ...
    "ami_name": "ami_name-{{isotime `2006-01-02-15-04-MST`| clean_resource_name}}"
  }], ...
}
```

`"template: hcl2_upgrade:3: unexpected \"\\\\\" in operand"` is not output in the `.pkr.hcl` file,
but a `.pkr.hcl` file using the intended format (`legacy_isotime`).

```hcl
source "amazon-ebs" "autogenerated_1" {
  ami_name = "ami_name-{{ clean_resource_name `${legacy_isotime("2006-01-02-15-04-MST")}` }}"

```
